### Binary Tree Documentation for implemented Methods and ideas

**Full Binary Tree**

A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. The following are examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children.

- The code of [MaxDepth](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/DataStructure/blob/main/BinaryTree/maxDepth.cpp) we made at the return + 1, to calculate the depth of the root
- The code that checks of the Tree is full or not [FBT](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/DataStructure/blob/main/BinaryTree/is_fullBT.cpp#L14) is what a binary tree is, if it's leaf then we return true, else we should check that the node have two childrens (right, and left)

-> [level-order-traversal](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/DataStructure/blob/main/BinaryTree/level_order_traversal.cpp)
> We print nodes according to the level with using a queue, so we print each level
