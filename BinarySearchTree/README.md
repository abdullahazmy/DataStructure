### Binary Search Tree (BST)

Time complexity for searching for an element inside the BST is o(h) where h is the height of the tree --- is same with o(logn) in case the tree is balanced, as if tree is balanced it's height is o(logn).

Inorder Traversal is always sorted for BST

---

Successor in a BST is the first element after you in sorted order
which means, the smallest node at your right subtrees.
